TAREK CHAALAN
Software Engineer | Systems Builder

I build systems that remove friction.

My work lives at the intersection of engineering, operations, and applied intelligence.
I design software that replaces spreadsheets, centralizes chaos, reduces manual work,
and gives teams real-time visibility into what matters.

From AWS-backed analytics platforms to internal purchasing automation systems,
I focus on one principle:

If a process repeats, it should be engineered.

I’ve worked across startups, enterprise environments, and freelance engagements —
building dashboards, CMS platforms, ecommerce systems, workflow controllers,
object detection models, browser extensions, and cloud-native infrastructure.

Technically, I’m full-stack.
Practically, I’m systems-first.
Strategically, I think in leverage.

Current focus:
• Workflow automation & operational control systems
• Applied AI in real-world business environments
• High-performance front-end architecture
• Cloud-native scalable deployments
• Turning complex processes into intuitive interfaces
