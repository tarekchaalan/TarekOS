# CHESSvsGPT

## Short Description

A web-based interface that lets users play chess against OpenAI's GPT models and explore how they handle strategic decision-making.

## Overview

CHESSvsGPT connects a browser-based chess board with the OpenAI API, allowing users to play full games where GPT models generate moves in real time. The project serves as both a fun way to test LLM reasoning against structured game rules and a sandbox for experimenting with different model configurations like creativity levels. The lightweight front-end handles game state tracking, move validation, and check/checkmate detection entirely in the browser.

## Features

- Play full chess games against GPT models directly in the browser
- Configure model parameters like creativity level to change playstyle
- Track game state with automatic check and checkmate detection
- Validate moves in real time with an interactive chess board UI
- Run as a lightweight client-side experience with no backend required beyond the API
