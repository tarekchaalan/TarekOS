Objectives:
• Build something “small” (ended up building an internal ERP)
• Quick side project (became production tool used daily)
• Refactor later (refactored immediately)
• Keep it simple (added monitoring, logs, RBAC, and CI/CD)
• Read the documentation before asking ChatGPT
• Write unit tests (lol)
